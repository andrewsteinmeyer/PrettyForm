# Request

This was a redesign and rewrite of an estimate request form.  I modularized all steps into separate components.  This is the front-end code only.  I wrote all supporting code for backend calls in Javascript, MongoDB and Meteor.js.

## First step

User types in address and addresses are pulled via Google Maps API.

## Second step

User selects address from dropdown populated by Google Maps API and confirms.
